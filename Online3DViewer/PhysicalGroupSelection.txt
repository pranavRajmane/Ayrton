# Physical Group Selection System in Online3DViewer

This document explains how physical group selection is implemented across various files in the Online3DViewer codebase.

## Core Files and Their Roles

### 1. Model Definition (source/engine/model/property.js)
The fundamental class that defines physical groups is `PhysicalGroup` in `property.js`. This class:
- Stores the physical group's name
- Maintains a `Set` of mesh IDs that belong to the group
- Tracks face indices for each mesh using a `Map` where mesh IDs are keys and arrays of face indices are values
- Provides methods for adding and removing meshes from the group
- Offers utilities for checking if a mesh is in the group and retrieving face indices

### 2. Storage in Model (source/engine/model/model.js)
The `Model` class stores physical groups in an array property:
```javascript
this.physicalGroups = [];
```

It provides these key methods related to physical groups:
- `GetPhysicalGroup(index)`: Gets a group by index
- `PhysicalGroupCount()`: Returns the number of groups
- `AddPhysicalGroup(group)`: Adds a new group to the model
- `RemovePhysicalGroup(index)`: Removes a group by index

### 3. Export Selection (source/website/exportdialog.js)
The physical group selection for export is handled in the export dialog. Key parts:

- The dialog creates checkboxes for each physical group
- Selected groups are stored in an array of group indices
- These selections are then passed to the exporter through the `exporterSettings` object:
```javascript
exporterSettings.selectedGroups = selectedGroups;
exporterSettings.exportSelectedOnly = true;
```

### 4. Exporter Configuration (source/engine/export/exportermodel.js)
The `ExporterModel` class maintains settings for export operations, including:
- `exportPhysicalGroups`: Flag to enable physical group export 
- `selectedGroups`: Array of group indices selected for export
- `exportSelectedOnly`: Flag to export only selected groups
- `exportRemainder`: Flag to export the remainder (unassigned geometry)

### 5. Export Implementation (source/engine/export/exporterstl.js)
The actual export of selected groups is handled in the STL exporter:

- The `ExportPhysicalGroups` method reads the `selectedGroups` array
- It processes each physical group and checks if it's included in the selection
- For selected groups, it creates filtered models containing only the relevant meshes
- Maintains tracking of which meshes/faces have been exported to enable remainder export

### 6. Selection Interface (source/website/website.js)
The website interface has methods for interacting with physical groups:
- `ShowPhysicalGroupsDialog()`: Shows the groups dialog
- `IsolatePhysicalGroup(groupIndex)`: Isolates a specific group visually
- `ExportPhysicalGroupAsStl(groupIndex)`: Direct export of a single group

### 7. Navigator (source/website/navigator.js, source/website/navigatormeshespanel.js)
The navigator panels allow:
- Selection of mesh items associated with physical groups
- Tracking of visible/hidden states of meshes
- Methods for hiding/showing meshes based on groups

## Data Flow for Physical Group Selection

1. **Creation**: Physical groups are created during model import (primarily from CAD files)
2. **Storage**: Groups are stored in the model.physicalGroups array
3. **Selection**:
   - User selects groups in export dialog
   - Selection is stored as indices in an array
   - The array is passed to the exporter via settings object
4. **Filtering**:
   - Exporter creates filtered models for each selected group
   - Each filtered model contains only meshes from the corresponding group
   - If exporting unassigned geometry, a model is created with meshes not in any group
5. **Export**:
   - Each filtered model is exported according to format-specific requirements
   - For STL, separate files can be created for each group

## Identifying Unassigned Geometry

The system tracks which meshes and faces have been assigned to groups:
- A Map tracks which mesh faces have already been added to groups
- When exporting "remainder" or "unassigned" geometry, the system:
  1. Creates a new model
  2. Adds only meshes not in any group
  3. For partially-assigned meshes, adds only unassigned faces

## Potential Improvements

1. Add physical group selection persistence between sessions
2. Implement group hierarchy visualization
3. Add color coding for different physical groups
4. Improve performance for models with many groups
5. Add ability to create new physical groups from the interface
